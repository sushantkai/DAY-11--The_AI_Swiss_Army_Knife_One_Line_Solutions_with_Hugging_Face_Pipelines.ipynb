🚀 Hugging Face Transformers – NLP & Computer Vision Pipeline Tutorial

This repository contains a hands-on tutorial exploring multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) tasks using the powerful Hugging Face transformers library. The goal of this project is to provide simple, ready-to-run examples that demonstrate how to use different pre-trained models for real-world AI applications.

📘 Project Overview

This notebook walks through essential AI tasks using Hugging Face pipelines:

🧠 Natural Language Processing Tasks

Sentiment Analysis – Determine the sentiment of text.

Text Summarization – Generate short, meaningful summaries.

Question Answering – Extract answers from a passage.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Identify entities like names, places, dates.

Text Generation – Produce new text from a given prompt.

Zero-Shot Classification – Classify text into unseen categories.

Translation – Translate text between languages.

🖼️ Computer Vision Tasks

Image Classification – Predict the main object in an image.

Object Detection – Detect and draw bounding boxes around objects.

Image Segmentation – Segment different regions/objects within an image.

Image Captioning – Generate natural language captions for images.
